# .github/workflows/ci.yml

# ✨ Name of the workflow that will appear in the "Actions" tab on GitHub
name: Run Tests

# ✨ Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# ✨ A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build-and-test"
  build-and-test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up a specific version of Node.js for our job to use
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm' # This will cache npm dependencies to speed up future runs

      # Step 3: Installs the project dependencies. 'npm ci' is recommended for CI.
      # It's faster and safer than 'npm install' because it uses the package-lock.json file.
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Runs the test script defined in your package.json
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        env: # ✨ Add this 'env' block to provide the secrets to the test runner
